## Overview
This is my day planner for the fifth homework assignment. A user can add input into to future hours, but not the current hour or the previous ones. They can save to local storage and remove on click. It is responsive as well.

## Completed:
* Responsive design
* Uses moment.js api for date as well as time 
* saves calendar input to local storage, and keeps in input on refresh
* can remove from local storage by clicking x
* time blocks are color-coded and bar user from input if needed
* used font-awesome for icons
